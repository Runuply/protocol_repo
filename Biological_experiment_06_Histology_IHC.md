# Protocol: Histology IHC Method

## Immunohistochemistry (IHC)

### Tissue Preparation
1. Fix the **human OA cartilage** or **mouse knee joint** in **4% paraformaldehyde** at 4°C for 48 hours.  
2. Rinse the tissue 3 times in **double distilled water** (10 minutes each).  
3. Decalcify the tissue in **45% formic acid + 20% sodium citrate dihydrate** for 7 days.  
4. Rinse in **fresh tap water**, then dehydrate overnight in **70% ethanol (ETOH)**.  
5. Perform further dehydration:  
   - **90% ETOH** for 1 hour  
   - **95% ETOH** for 2 hours  
   - **100% ETOH** for 3 hours  
6. Treat tissue with **xylene** for 2 hours.  
7. Embed tissue in **paraffin** and section at **5 μm** thickness.  


### Prepare the Sodium Citrate/Formic Acid Decalcification reagent (45% formic acid + 20% sodium citrate dihydrate)
1. 20 % sodium citrate dihydrate: dissolve 100 g of sodium citrate dihydrate in 350 mL of dH2O; add dH2O to a final volume of 500 mL.
2. 45 % formic acid: To prepare 500 mL dilute 225 mL of >95 % formic acid in 275 mL of dH2O.
3. Mix 250 mL of 45 % formic acid with 250 mL of 20 % sodium citrate dihydrate solution. Add decalcification solution to sample. The recommended volume of decalcification solution is at least 15–20× the volume of tissue.
4. Incubate samples at room temperature on a rocker for 2–3 days.
5. Assess samples to determine if they are decalcified after 2–3 days (see the decalcification test below using a solution of satu- rated ammonium oxalate).
6. Change the 45 % formic acid/ 20 % sodium citrate dihydrate fixation solution for fresh solution every 3 days. The decalcifi- cation should be complete within in approximately 5–7 days.

### IHC Staining Protocol: H3K9me3 on Osteochondral Tissue

#### **Day 1: Pre-Staining**
1. Bake slides at **65°C** for 2–3 hours.  
2. Deparaffinize tissue:  
   - Two changes of **xylene** (8 minutes each).  
   - Rehydrate through:  
     - **100% ethanol** (2 changes, 5 minutes each).  
     - **95%, 85%, and 70% ethanol** (1 change each, 5 minutes each).  
3. Wash slides in **deionized water** (2 changes, 5 minutes each).  
4. Perform antigen retrieval:  
   - Step 1: Use **Sodium Citrate Buffer** (10 mM Sodium citrate, 0.05% Tween 20, pH 6.0) at **65°C** for 3–4 hours.  
   - Cool slides to room temperature, rinse in 3 changes of **deionized water**.  
   - Step 2: Use pre-warmed (37°C) **Hyaluronidase solution** (0.5 mg/mL in PBS) at **37°C** for 15–20 minutes.  
5. Wash slides in 3 changes of **PBS**.  
6. Outline sections with a **PAP pen**.  
7. Quench endogenous peroxidase activity using **3–5% H2O2 solution in PBS** for 10 minutes.  
8. Rinse in **deionized water** (2 changes).  
9. Block non-specific binding with **1% BSA + 5% goat serum in PBST (0.1% Tween)** for 1 hour.  
10. Prepare **primary antibody**:  
    - Dilute **H3K9me3 primary antibody** (Cell Signaling #13969 or Invitrogen PA5-31910) to **1:50–1:100** in **Normal Goat Serum**.  
11. Drain serum and incubate slides overnight at **4°C**.  

#### **Day 2: Staining**
1. Wash slides in 5 changes of **PBS**.  
2. Incubate with **secondary antibody** (1:500 in 1% BSA + 5% goat serum) at **room temperature** for 2 hours.  
3. Wash slides in 3 changes of **PBS**.  
4. Prepare **ABC reagent** (5 μL A + 5 μL B in 500 mL PBS) 30 minutes prior to use.  
5. Incubate slides with **ABC reagent** at room temperature for 30 minutes.  
6. Wash in 3 changes of **PBS**.  
7. Prepare **DAB substrate** (100 mL + 3 mL) just before staining.  
8. Stain slides with **DAB substrate** for ~5 minutes, monitoring staining progress.  
9. Wash slides in **deionized water**.  

#### **Post-Staining**
1. Quickly rinse in **95% ethanol**.  
2. Wash in **100% ethanol** for 2 minutes.  
3. Clear in **xylene** (2 changes, 5 minutes each).  
4. Mount slides:  
   - Add 2 drops of **custom mounting medium**.  
   - Cover with a **glass coverslip**.
