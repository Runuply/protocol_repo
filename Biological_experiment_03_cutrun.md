### Below are our recommendations for H3K9me2 and H3K9me3
If the specific lot numbers listed below are no longer available, it is best to try the newest lot from the same vendor. However, it’s important to note that the new lot might not perform as successfully as the previous ones. 

For **H3K79me1/2/3**, there are no specific recommendations. In such cases, it is advised to test 3-5 different antibodies from various vendors, ideally targeting different epitopes of the protein. Monoclonal antibodies that are IF-validated (immunofluorescence) should be prioritized. Testing should be conducted in parallel with positive and negative controls to identify the most effective antibody.
