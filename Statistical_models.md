#### Statical models
* The model is our view of the process
* It aims at representing the data generating process
* Summarizeds a set of assumptions
* Specifies relations between varibales
* Help to calculate the probability of the data under some assumptions.

#### Binomial model
"All models are wrong, but some are useful." 
                                  -George Box
* The model is over-simplifying
* Factors like age, region, other preconditions are neglected
* The assumed n% are subject to uncertainfy

But ...
* Can be a starting point of further investigation
* A straight-forward estimate of how unsual the data are

#### Example
When the true prevalece is 4%, the probability of observing an event of 9/100 (or more extreme) is **p=0.02**.
