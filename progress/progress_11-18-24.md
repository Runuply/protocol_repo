# Orders and Priorities (11-18-2024)

## Paper Priorities:
1. **Senp6 OC** – Needs ERV overexpression experiment.
2. **G9a** – Do we need NCC data? Should we submit first, then validate later?
3. **SENP6/OA** – Collect the aging group first.
4. **Omics OA Review** – Working with Vlad on the Figures; to submit to OAC.
5. **OA ERV Project** – Split responsibilities with Yaguang, Peter, and Vlad.

### **1. Senp6 OA (#4)**
#### a. Phenotype OA
1. **Senp6-Acan (OA phenotype data)**
   - **Micro-CT**: Done. Need histology and scoring.
     - KO pre-injury: Finished.
     - KO aging: Finished.
     - KO post-injury: Finished.
   - **Histology**: Safranin O/Fast Green – Pending (n=3 for first impression, expand later).  
     - Prioritize iTG and aging; PTOA already known.
     - Transactional µCT images from aging KO.
   
2. **Senp6-itg-Acan (Embedding samples for histology)**
   - **Cross with Acan** for OA alleviation – Expand cages (**IMPORTANT**).
   - Pre-injury (n=6): Scanned, scoring pending.
   - Catwalk: Improvement observed in some parameters.
   - Open field test: Permission granted, training needed.
   - **Collect**: 18mo iTG for ECM histology.
   - RNA-seq: Use Mayo gene sets or generate new.

3. **Prx1-cre Crosses**
   - Newborn cartilage phenotype (P0): Histology pending.
   - P21: Collected, micro-CT and histology pending.
   - Histology expected: Thicker cartilage in GP and AC.

4. **Col2 Cross**
   - RNA-seq data collection needed.

#### b. Stress Response of Senp6 and Polysumoylation
- Analyze Jianshuang’s MS data: H1 polySUMO, Senp6, ERV.

#### c. Data Analysis
- Finish RNA-seq and WGBS.
- Prepare figures and legends.
