1. **Euthanize** a 6-week-old to 8-week-old mouse.

2. **Dissect** the hind limbs to expose the femur and tibia. Remove muscles to isolate bone tissue.

3. **Place** bone tissue in cold PBS (with penicillin-streptomycin, PS) in a 3 cm dish to keep it fresh.

4. **Prepare** a 0.5 mL tube by drilling a hole at the bottom with a needle. Ensure the hole allows bone marrow to pass through but retains the bone tissue.

5. **Cut off** the femur and tibial heads, insert bones into the 0.5 mL tube, and spin down at no more than 5000 x g.

6. **Collect** the bone marrow at the bottom of a 1.5 mL tube and discard the 0.5 mL tube.

7. **Prepare** a 15 mL tube with 8 mL of PBS (with PS) for each sample.

8. **Resuspend** the bone marrow pellet in 1 mL of PBS by pipetting up and down, then transfer to the 15 mL tube.

9. **Spin down** the suspension at 500 x g for 5 minutes, then use eBioscience™ 10X RBC Lysis Buffer (Multi-species) for RBC depletion.
    
   -Dilute 10x RBC lysis buffer in reagent grade water (1:10) at RT.
   -After c.f.g resuspend pellet in 3-10 mL of prepared 1xRBC lysis buffer.
   -Incubate for 4-5 min ar RT
   -c.f.g 500 x g for 5 min at RT

11. **Resuspend** the pellet in 1 mL of PBS (without Ca or Mg) with 0.04% BSA and vortex gently.

12. **Perform** a cell count and viability check using Trypan blue and a cell counter (BioRad TC10 Automated Cell Counter in the lab or Luna in the core).

13. **Analyze** samples with CytoFLEX.

QC review- Your cells look great, the viability is hovering between 80-90% live with ~10% RBCs. This should be just fine for the assay that you’ve selected. I’ve reviewed the images from the luna and the cell membranes look nice and intact and I’m seeing very little debris. Concentrations were 31,700/uL which is great. What was the total volume you had?
 
Project details- On Nov. 7th we will need at least 200,000 cells at a concentration of 3000/uL in PBS (no Ca or Mg) w/ .04% BSA (more is always fine). We will run all 4 samples on the luna and the cytoflex prior to moving forward with the 10X portion. Please bring an extra vial of just buffer (~1ml) so we can use that to dilute if necessary. We have you scheduled for drop off at noon, please stick around for the QC. We will briefly talk about the quality and any issues prior to moving forward.
 
Assay: 5’ v1.1
Target cell #- 10,000 per sample
Sequencing- 20,000 paired end reads (2x100) per cell*4 samples*10,000 cells per sample= 800M reads
