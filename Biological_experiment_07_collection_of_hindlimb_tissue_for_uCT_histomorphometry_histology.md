# Protocol: Collection of Hindlimb Tissues for µCT Histomorphometry or Histology Staining
## Materials:
* 10% Neutral Buffered Formalin (NBF, prepared from 37% formalin stock diluted to 4% in 1X PBS; 500 mL 10% NBF = 54 mL 37% formalin + 446 mL 1x PBS)
* 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tubes
* 50 mL tubes
* Tissue cassettes
* Foil
* 70% ethanol

## 1.Preparation
1. Prepare ~500 mL of 10% NBF and pour into a 1 L beaker. Cover with foil to protect from light.
2. Label:
    * 1.5 mL tubes for tail tips (one per mouse)
    * Two cassettes per mouse (right and left hindlimb)
    * One 50 mL tube per mouse (for skull or other optional tissues) and fill with ≥30 mL NBF

## 2. Mouse Sacrifice and Sample Collection
1. Sacrifice mice one at a time.
2. Tail tip collection:
    * Cut the tail and place it in the labeled 1.5 mL tube.
    * Store at -80°C for potential regeneration studies.

## 3. Right Hindlimb (for µCT or histomorphometry)
1. Harvest the right hindlimb.
2. For histomorphometry:
    * Separate femur and tibia.
    * Ensure the femur head remains intact.
    * Remove all muscles from the femur (muscle removal from tibia is not required).
## 3. Place:
    * Femur -> cassette 1 -> immediately submerge in NBF, protected from light
    * Tibia -> cassette 2 -> leave in NBF until left hindlimb collection

## 4. Left Hindlimb (for histology or combined fixation)
1. Harvest the left hindlimb, separating it entirely from the hip while keeping the femur head intact.
2. Remove excess muscles but leave some attached to the bone.
3. Place the entire left hindlimb in the same cassette as the right tibia. Submerge in 10% NBF.

## 5. Optional: Skull Collection
1. Remove skin from the skull.
2. Place the skull in a 50 mL tube filled with ≥30 mL NBF.
    * Optional: For µCT imaging.

## 6. Fixation and Storage
1. Fix tissues for 48 hours in NBF (cassettes kept in the dark).
2. Wash tissues in water for ≥40 minutes.
3. Replace water with 70% ethanol and store in a cool, dark location.

## Notes
* Right hindlimb is typically used for µCT.
* If blood collection is required, sacrifice mice 6 hours before tissue collection to allow sufficient time for blood processing.
