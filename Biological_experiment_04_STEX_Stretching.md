The following study by T. Tetsunaga et al. (*Osteoarthritis and Cartilage*, 2011) investigates the effects of mechanical stretching on cellular activity. [Read the full article here](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1063458410003894?via%3Dihub).
- A cyclic tensile strain of 0.5 Hz at 10% elongation was applied for 30 minutes.

Another important study by Chang, S.H., Mori, D., Kobayashi, H., et al. (*Nature Communications*, 2019) highlights how excessive mechanical loading drives osteoarthritis progression via the gremlin-1–NF-κB pathway. [Access the full article here](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-019-09491-5).
- In this study, mouse primary chondrocytes were seeded into silicon stretch chambers coated with fibronectin at a density of 1 × 10⁵ cells per chamber (2 × 2 cm culture surface). After 48 hours, cyclic tensile strain (0.5 Hz, 10% elongation) was applied for 30 minutes using the STB-140 mechanical stretch system (STREX, Osaka, Japan) in a CO₂ incubator.
