# Mouse Growth Plate Chondrocyte Isolation and Primary Culture

1. Euthanize mice (< P7);
2. Dissect and isolate the growth plate tissue;
3. Carefully remove the ligaments and tendons attached to the growth plate cartilage tissue under a stereomicroscope;
4. Place the preliminarily processed growth plate tissue into a 12-well plate;
5. Wash twice with PBS;
6. Add 500 µl of streptomycin-protease solution (1 mg/ml, in PBS; stock is 3 mg/ml, keep at -20°C) to cover the cartilage tissue;
7. Incubate at 37°C for 1 hour;
8. Transfer the growth plate cartilage tissue along with the protease solution into a 15 ml centrifuge tube;
9. Add 4 ml PBS, gently pipette up and down to dissociate the tissue, and aspirate the flocculent tissue;
10. Repeat step 9 until no more small tissue fragments detach from the growth plate cartilage;
11. Place the cleaned growth plate cartilage tissue into a 12-well plate;
12. Add 500 µl of collagenase type II solution (1 mg/ml, in α-MEM containing 10% FBS; stock is 10 mg/ml, keep at -20°C) to cover the cartilage tissue;
13. Tilt the 12-well plate containing the tissue and place it in a CO₂ incubator at 37°C overnight (12 hours);
14. Add 1 ml PBS to the 12-well plate and gently pipette up and down to dissociate the growth plate cartilage into a single-cell suspension;
15. Transfer the growth plate chondrocyte suspension into a 15 ml centrifuge tube, add 4 ml PBS to wash the cells, and aspirate any possible debris;
16. Centrifuge at 500 x g for 5 minutes;
17. Discard the supernatant, resuspend the cells in an appropriate amount of α-MEM medium;
18. Count the cells, then seed the growth plate chondrocytes into suitable culture dishes for subsequent experiments.
