## Procedure

### 1. Euthanize and Dissect
- Euthanize 6-week-old to 8-week-old mice according to institutional animal care guidelines.
- Dissect the hind limbs to expose the femur and tibia. Remove muscles to isolate bone tissue.
- Place bone tissue in cold PBS (with PS) in a 3 cm dish to keep it fresh.

### 2. Bone Marrow Extraction
- Prepare extraction tubes by placing a 0.5 mL tube inside a 1.5 mL tube for each mouse.
- Drill a hole in the bottom of the 0.5 mL tube. Ensure the hole allows bone marrow to pass through but retains the bone tissue.
- Cut off the femur and tibial heads, insert bones into the 0.5 mL tubes, and spin down at no more than 5000 x g.
- Collect the bone marrow at the bottom of the 1.5 mL tube and discard the 0.5 mL tube.

### 3. Washing Bone Marrow Cells
- Prepare complete medium by mixing 100 mL of α-MEM with 10% FBS.
- Prepare a 15 mL tube with 8 mL of PBS (with PS) for each sample.
- Resuspend the bone marrow pellet in 1 mL of PBS by pipetting up and down, then transfer to the 15 mL tube.
- Spin down the suspension at 2000 x g for 5 minutes.
- Resuspend the pellet in 5 mL of incomplete α-MEM and vortex gently.
- Spin down again at 2000 x g for 5 minutes.

### 4. Seeding Cells
- Prepare a 10 cm dish with 9 mL of complete α-MEM medium and add 1 mL of L929 medium (store L929 medium at -20°C after use; You can also use 0.5 mL L929 medium).
- Resuspend the cell pellet in the prepared medium and seed the cells in the dish.

### 5. Discard Attached Cells
- **Day 2**: The next morning, collect the supernatant by centrifuging at 2000 x g for 5 minutes. Discard attached cells, which should be MSC. 
- Prepare a fresh 10 cm dish with 9 mL of complete α-MEM medium and 1 mL of L929 medium.

### 6. Observation and M-CSF Addition
- **Day 3**: In the afternoon, floating pieces and round cells attaching to the bottom should be observed.
- Add M-CSF (stored in a labeled white paper box in the -80°C freezer). The M-CSF concentration is 30 ng/µL; the final concentration should be 50 ng/mL in a 10 mL medium. Add 1.7 µL of M-CSF to each plate. You can also add L929 to replace the M-CSF.

### 7. Washing, Medium Replacement, and Seeding
- **Day 4**: Wash cells three times with PBS, directing the pipette tip toward the plate wall to avoid disturbing cells.
  - **Medium Replacement**: If confluency is low, continue proliferation for another day. Add 9 mL of complete α-MEM medium and 1 mL of L929 medium after washing.
  - **Seeding Cells**: If cell density is high, add 4 mL Versene and place the plate in the fridge at 4°C for 6, 10, or 30 minutes. Detach cells by gentle pipetting, then resuspend in 3 mL of complete α-MEM with 5%-10% L929.

### 8. Cell Counting and Plating
- Count the cells. The yield should be around 10<sup>6</sup> monocytes per four bones.(In my case, I collected hind limbs of 4 mice, the total cell number is 2.28 x 10<sup>6</sup>; So if you only collect hind limbs the yield should be 0.6 x 10<sup>6</sup>.)
- Plate cells in 96-well flat-bottom plates at varying concentrations (2K, 4K, 6K, 8K, 10K cells per well) with a total volume of 200 µL per well.
  - *Note: RAW cells require 3000 cells per well. *
  - *Note: The BMDM can be up to 20K cells/well. However, in my assay, I seeded 20K cells per well, but by the next morning, the confluency was still insufficient for transfection, which requires approximately 70% confluency. Please consider seeding 30K or 40K cells per well (For Inducing Osteoclasts)*
- Plate cells in 12-well flat-bottom plates 3x10<sup>5</sup> cells/well.
- Plate cells in 6-well flat-bottom plates 6x10<sup>5</sup> cells/well (For qPCR).

### 9. Proliferation and Medium Replacement
- Allow cells to proliferate for one day to ensure attachment. Change the medium every 2-3 days, adding 5% L929 and 50-100 ng/mL His-RANKL.
  - *Note: Monocytes will appear round initially, then attach and flatten. Monitor cell morphology to determine when to change the medium*.

### 10. Osteoclast (OC) Formation Check
- Check for OC formation daily. OCs should begin appearing 3-5 days after RANKL is added.
- Stain cells immediately after observing OC formation, as they may disintegrate within 24 hours.


### 11. Preparation of L929 Medium (M-CSF Substitute)

1. Revive L929 cells at 37°C. Spin down the cells at 1500 rpm for 5 minutes.
2. Add G418 (1 mg/ml) for selection in H-DMEM supplemented with FBS, L-glutamine, and penicillin-streptomycin.
3. Once the cells reach 90% confluency, split them into three 10 cm dishes, adding 10 ml of medium to each.
4. Allow the cells to grow for 4 days.
5. Collect the conditioned medium, which will contain M-CSF.
6. Store the collected L929 medium in 15 ml tubes and freeze at -80°C for future use.
  
  - *Note: Give it a week, and make sure you have L929 before the experiment.*

### Below is a protocol of L929 Cell Maintenance and Conditioned Medium Preparation (Di Lu sent at 7/22/25)

#### 1. Cell Maintenance
L929 cells are maintained in **T-75 cm² flasks** with filter caps using **DMEM** supplemented with:
- 1% Penicillin-Streptomycin / L-glutamine  
- 10% heat-inactivated Fetal Bovine Serum (56°C for 30 minutes)

Cells are cultured under **5% CO₂ at 37°C**.  
*A 10 cm dish can be used as an alternative.*

#### 2. Cell Passage
Cells are passaged **once per week** following these steps:

1. Remove the culture medium from the T-75 flask.  
2. Add **10 ml of warm DPBS** and wash the cell surface by gently rocking the flask back and forth about ten times.  
3. Remove the wash solution and add **1.0 ml of Trypsin-EDTA**.  
4. Incubate for **no more than 5 minutes at 37°C**.  
5. Add **10 ml of complete culture medium**, and use a **10 ml pipette** to rinse the cells from the flask surface, pipetting up and down to disperse clumps.  
6. Transfer **1 drop of the suspension** into **20 ml of culture medium** in each new T-75 flask.  
7. Incubate for **7 days**, then repeat the procedure to maintain the culture.

#### 3. Preparation of L929 Conditioned Medium (L929CM)

1. Prepare **eight T-150 (800 ml) triple flasks** with filter caps.  
2. Add **150 ml of culture medium** to each flask.  
3. Count the cells in the trypsinized suspension.  
   - Each **150 cm² surface** requires **2.5 × 10⁵ cells**.  
4. Incubate for **7 days at 37°C, 5% CO₂**.  
   - Several times during the week, tip each flask upright and lay it flat again to evenly distribute the cells.  
5. At the end of the **first week**, collect the medium and filter it through a **0.2 µm filter**.  
6. Add **150 ml of fresh, pre-warmed culture medium** to each flask and incubate for another 7 days, tipping as before.  
7. The filtered **Week 1 L929CM** should be aliquoted into **50 ml Falcon tubes** and stored at **−20°C**.  
8. At the end of the **second week**, collect the medium again, discard the flasks and cells, and filter the **Week 2 L929CM** through a 0.2 µm filter.  
   - This step may require several filters due to cellular debris.  
9. Aliquot the filtered medium into **50 ml tubes**.  
   - The **Week 2 L929CM** is typically more potent.
  
#### 4. Storage and Use
- **Stability:** L929CM is stable for approximately **1 year at −20°C**.  
- **Quality Test:** Test the L929CM using a **bioassay for bone marrow-derived macrophage (BMDM) growth**.  
- **Before use:** Mix **equal volumes of Week 1 and Week 2 L929CM**.  
- **Aliquoting:** If necessary, aliquot into **10 cm tubes**.  
- **In osteoclast cultures:** Use a **1:10 dilution** of the mixed L929CM to replace M-CSF.

**Note:** Week 2 conditioned medium often shows higher potency due to accumulated cytokines and growth factors.
