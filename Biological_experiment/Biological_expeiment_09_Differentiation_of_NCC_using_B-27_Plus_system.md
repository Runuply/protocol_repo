## Protocol: Differentiation of E10.5 Mouse NCCs Using B-27 Plus System

### Materials

#### B-27 Plus Neuronal Culture System (A3653401, Thermo Fisher)
- Neurobasal Plus Medium (500 mL)
- B-27 Plus Supplement (50X, 10 mL)

#### Other reagents
- Penicillin/Streptomycin
- Poly-D-lysine (or fibronectin)
- G9a inhibitor (your compound)
- NCCs from E10.5 mouse embryos
- PBS (calcium/magnesium-free)
- 0.05% Trypsin (for suspension if needed)

---

### Step 1: Plate Preparation
- Coat dishes with **fibronectin (10 μg/mL in PBS, 1–2 hours at 37°C)**  
  **or** **poly-D-lysine + laminin** overnight at 4°C.
- Rinse plates once with PBS before seeding cells.

---

### Step 2: NCC Preparation
- Isolate **E10.5 NCCs** using your standard protocol.
- Dissociate cells gently into a **single-cell suspension** using TrypLE or mechanical pipetting.
- Count cells and adjust to **~1–2 × 10⁵ cells/mL** for plating.

### Step 3: Prepare Differentiation Medium

Mix the following in a sterile tube:

| Component | Volume | Final concentration |
|----------|--------|---------------------|
| Neurobasal Plus Medium | 49 mL | — |
| B-27 Plus Supplement (50X) | 1 mL | 1X |
| GlutaMAX™ (optional) | 0.5–1 mL | 2 mM |
| Pen/Strep (optional) | 1% | — |

- Mix gently and pre-warm to **37°C**.

---

### Step 4: Plating Cells
- Plate NCCs at **~50–70% confluency**.
- Add **G9a inhibitor** to experimental wells; add **vehicle** to the control group.
- Incubate at **37°C, 5% CO₂**.

---

### Step 5: Culture & Maintenance
- Change **half of the medium every 2–3 days**.
- Monitor neuronal differentiation:
  - neurite extension
  - round neuronal soma
  - network formation

---

### Step 6: Analysis

#### Recommended time points
- **Day 5–7**: good neurite outgrowth and clear neuron morphology.

#### Immunostaining markers
- **Tuj1 (βIII-tubulin)** — neuron-specific marker  
- **MAP2** — mature neuron dendrites  
- **Peripherin** — peripheral neuron marker  

#### Quantification
- Count **Tuj1-positive** neurons vs **DAPI** total cells.
- Measure neurite **length**, **branch points**, and **network density**.

### Tips / Notes
- **Avoid serum** — it inhibits neuronal differentiation.  
- **G9a inhibitor timing:** start immediately after plating for maximal effect.  
- **Optional positive controls:** NGF, BDNF, NT-3 (10–20 ng/mL).  
- **Storage:** aliquot B-27 Plus Supplement at −20°C to avoid freeze–thaw cycles.  
- **Coating matters:** poly-D-lysine + laminin gives the strongest neurite outgrowth.
