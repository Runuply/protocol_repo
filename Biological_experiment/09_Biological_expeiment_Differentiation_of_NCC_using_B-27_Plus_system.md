## Protocol: Differentiation of E10.5 Mouse NCCs Using B-27 Plus System
### Materials
#### B-27 Plus Neuronal Culture System (A3653401, Thermo Fisher)
-Neurobasal Plus Medium (500 mL)
-B-27 Plus Supplement (50X, 10 mL)
#### Penicillin/Streptomycin
#### poly-D-lysine
#### G9a inhibitor (your compound)
#### NCCs from E10.5 mouse embryos
#### PBS (calcium/magnesium-free)
#### 0.05% Trypsin (for suspension if needed)
Step 1: Plate Preparation
Coat dishes with fibronectin (10 μg/mL in PBS, 1–2 hours at 37°C) or poly-D-lysine + laminin overnight at 4°C.
Rinse plates once with PBS before seeding cells.
Step 2: NCC Preparation
Isolate E10.5 NCCs according to your usual protocol.
Dissociate cells gently into single-cell suspension using TrypLE or mechanical pipetting.
Count cells and adjust to ~1–2 × 10^5 cells/mL for plating.
Step 3: Prepare Differentiation Medium
In a sterile tube, combine:
Neurobasal Plus Medium: 49 mL
B-27 Plus Supplement (50X): 1 mL → final 1X
GlutaMAX™ (100X, optional): 0.5–1 mL → final 2 mM
Pen/Strep (optional): 1%
Mix gently and warm to 37°C before adding to cells.
Step 4: Plating Cells
Plate NCCs at a density of ~50–70% confluency.
Add G9a inhibitor to your experimental group; add vehicle control to the control group.
Incubate at 37°C, 5% CO2.
Step 5: Culture & Maintenance
Change half of the medium every 2–3 days.
Monitor for neuronal morphology (neurite extension, round soma, network formation).
Step 6: Analysis
Time points: typically 5–7 days after plating are sufficient to see neurite outgrowth.
Immunostaining markers:
Tuj1 (βIII-tubulin) → neuron-specific
MAP2 → dendrites / mature neurons
Peripherin → peripheral neuron identity
Quantification:
Count Tuj1-positive cells vs total cells (DAPI).
Measure neurite length/branching.
