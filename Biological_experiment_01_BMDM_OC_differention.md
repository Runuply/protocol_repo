# Protocol for Inducing Osteoclasts from Monocytes Collected from Bone Marrow

## Reagents and Materials
- **Incomplete α-MEM** (cat #: 12561, 500 mL): Nutrient-supplemented medium from Gibco-Invitrogen with 1% antibiotics, no FBS, and no ribonucleosides/deoxyribonucleosides.
- **Complete α-MEM**: Incomplete α-MEM supplemented with 10% FBS.
- **Versene** (cat #: 15040-066, 100 mL): EDTA solution from Gibco-Invitrogen.
  - *Note: We use PBS+EDTA; the EDTA stock is 0.5M, 1000X. Mix 50 mL PBS with 50 µL 1000X EDTA*.
- **M-CSF** (cat #: 216-MC): Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor from R&D Systems.
- **RANKL** (cat #: 462-TEC): Receptor Activator of Nuclear Factor Kappa-B Ligand from R&D Systems.
  - *Alternative RANKL: Provided by Dr. Darney (1.65 µg/µL)*.
- **L929**: M-CSF substitute provided by Dr. Darney.

## Procedure

### 1. Euthanize and Dissect
- Euthanize 6-week-old to 8-week-old mice according to institutional animal care guidelines.
- Dissect the hind limbs to expose the femur and tibia. Remove muscles to isolate bone tissue.
- Place bone tissue in cold PBS (with PS) in a 3 cm dish to keep it fresh.

### 2. Bone Marrow Extraction
- Prepare extraction tubes by placing a 0.5 mL tube inside a 1.5 mL tube for each mouse.
- Drill a hole in the bottom of the 0.5 mL tube. Ensure the hole allows bone marrow to pass through but retains the bone tissue.
- Cut off the femur and tibial heads, insert bones into the 0.5 mL tubes, and spin down at no more than 5000 x g.
- Collect the bone marrow at the bottom of the 1.5 mL tube and discard the 0.5 mL tube.

### 3. Washing Bone Marrow Cells
- Prepare complete medium by mixing 100 mL of α-MEM with 10% FBS.
- Prepare a 15 mL tube with 8 mL of PBS (with PS) for each sample.
- Resuspend the bone marrow pellet in 1 mL of PBS by pipetting up and down, then transfer to the 15 mL tube.
- Spin down the suspension at 2000 x g for 5 minutes.
- Resuspend the pellet in 5 mL of incomplete α-MEM and vortex gently.
- Spin down again at 2000 x g for 5 minutes.

### 4. Seeding Cells
- Prepare a 10 cm dish with 9 mL of complete α-MEM medium and add 1 mL of L929 medium (store L929 medium at -20°C after use).
- Resuspend the cell pellet in the prepared medium and seed the cells in the dish.

### 5. Discard Attached Cells
- **Day 2**: The next morning, collect the supernatant and discard attached cells by centrifuging at 2000 x g for 5 minutes.
- Prepare a fresh 10 cm dish with 9 mL of complete α-MEM medium and 1 mL of L929 medium.

### 6. Observation and M-CSF Addition
- **Day 3**: In the afternoon, floating pieces and round cells attaching to the bottom should be observed.
- Add M-CSF (stored in a labeled white paper box in the -80°C freezer). The M-CSF concentration is 30 ng/µL; the final concentration should be 50 ng/mL in a 10 mL medium. Add 1.7 µL of M-CSF to each plate.

### 7. Washing, Medium Replacement, and Seeding
- **Day 4**: Wash cells three times with PBS, directing the pipette tip toward the plate wall to avoid disturbing cells.
  - **Medium Replacement**: If confluency is low, continue proliferation for another day. Add 9 mL of complete α-MEM medium and 1 mL of L929 medium after washing.
  - **Seeding Cells**: If cell density is high, add 4 mL Versene and place the plate in the fridge at 4°C for 6, 10, or 30 minutes. Detach cells by gentle pipetting, then resuspend in 3 mL of complete α-MEM with 5%-10% L929.

### 8. Cell Counting and Plating
- Count the cells. The yield should be around 10^6 monocytes per four bones.
- Plate cells in 96-well flat-bottom plates at varying concentrations (2K, 4K, 6K, 8K, 10K cells per well) with a total volume of 200 µL per well.
  - *Note: RAW cells require 3000 cells per well*.

### 9. Proliferation and Medium Replacement
- Allow cells to proliferate for one day to ensure attachment. Change the medium every 2-3 days, adding 5% L929 and 50-100 ng/mL His-RANKL.
  - *Note: Monocytes will appear round initially, then attach and flatten. Monitor cell morphology to determine when to change the medium*.

### 10. Osteoclast (OC) Formation Check
- Check for OC formation daily. OCs should begin appearing 3-5 days after RANKL is added.
- Stain cells immediately after observing OC formation, as they may disintegrate within 24 hours.
